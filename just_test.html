    <h2>
       A Beginner’s Introduction to GitHub
    </h2>
      <p>
            GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.<br>
            To understand exactly what GitHub is, you need to know two connected principles:<br>
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li>
              Version Control
          </li>
          <li>
              Git
          </li>
      </ul>
     <h2>
       What is version control?
     </h2>
       <p>
        Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code.<br>
        As a software project grows, version control becomes essential. Take WordPress…</br></p>
  
       <p>
        At this point, WordPress is a pretty big project.<br>
        If a core developer wanted to work on one specific part of the WordPress codebase, it wouldn’t be safe or efficient to have them directly edit the “official” source code.</br></p>
       </p>

        <br>
       </p>

       <p>
        Instead, version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging.
       </p>

       <p>
        With <strong>branching</strong>, a developer duplicates part of the source code (called the repository). The developer can then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the rest of the project.
       </p>

       <p>
        Then, once the developer gets his or her part of the code working properly, he or she can <strong>merge</strong> that code back into the main source code to make it official.
       </p>
